[Refrain]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I'm walking all by myself
I'm lost, but no one can tell
I kept the words to myself
'Cause you know how I always felt

[Chorus]
I feel better with you
I don't even know whatever we have now
But I don't want to destroy it
When we're in the same room
Always try my best to just forget
How I keep falling for you

[Refrain]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Don't expect me just to hide it
Put out this flame we ignited
Don't act like our fate's decided
We both know you're not that short-sighted
(Gotta pull it together, I'll be fine) Don't expect me just to hide it
(If I don't answer my phone, don't ask why) Put out this flame we ignited
(If you ever need someone to rely on) Don't act like our fate's decided
(Know that I'll be always by your side) We both know you're not that short-sighted

[Bridge]
Gotta pull it together, I'll be fine
If I don't answer my phone, don't ask why
If you ever need someone to rely on
Know that I'll be always by your side

[Chorus]
I feel better with you
I don't even know whatever we have now
But I don't want to destroy it
When we're in the same room
I always try my best to just forget
How I keep falling for you
I feel better with you
I don't even know whatever we have now
But I don't want to destroy it
When we're in the same room
I always try my best to just forget
How I keep falling for you
