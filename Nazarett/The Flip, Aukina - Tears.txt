Tears come down like water falls
If I dont care who will at all
It's okay
It's alright
It's fine
If you say we're friends
It's okay
It's alright
I am fine
Cause it's not the end
Lay me down where I can sleep
Hold me close
Don't say a thing
It's okay
It's alright
I am fine
Don't ask again
It's okay
I'm alright
I'm fine
If you say we're friends
