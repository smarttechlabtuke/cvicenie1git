"My husband's at home with man flu"
"But I love him"
Lately, I don't know what they mean
I've been having trouble with my needs
You pull my soul out my veins
It won't apologise (aye, aye)
Talk my shit and sing my peace
Why they phoning? I'm on leave
I'm blowing smoke its through the morning
Keep me foreign, keep me deep
I'm all good, where were you?
I've been camping online
Clones, lookalikes, only one of my kind
Why are they lying on me? I'm a wave overseas
I need strains, I need trees, I need something for my time
I don't know where I'm at, but my soul needs a map (uh)
Lately, I don't know what they mean
I've been having trouble with my needs
You pull my soul out my veins
It won't apologise (aye, aye)
Gas into this boredom, putting fuel into a starship
Purple haze like Thanos, delete that I Tony Stark'd it
Put away the camera, I like the point of view
You're not chasing life, so, what's the point in you?
I said "Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye" like I'm Boiji
We don't sesh, we don't queue, I don't miss you
You don't know me (yeah)
Got them on the edge, they won't let me in
Get there, get there, get there in the end
Shit, I'm stuck, I'm attached
Wasn't ready for this round
Slept for 20 years, kept a pillow on a cloud
Roadcheck, I'm not ready, I don't trip for fun
It's ammo for a dream, I dreamt a million guns
Blackbox sativa, great barrier reefer, don't know my settings
I go far, off a cliff, I'll get a roadrunner ending
Moving mad, must be something I'm not hearing
My soul left and came back with a message
Lately, I don't know what they mean
I've been having trouble with my needs
You pull my soul out my veins, yeah
It won't apologise
Shit, I'm stuck, talk to 'em, talk to 'em
Shit, I'm stuck, talk to 'em, talk to 'em
Shit I'm stuck, talk to 'em
When you're alright
When you're alright
When you're alright
When you're alright
When you're alright
When you're alright
When you're alright
When you're alright
When you're alright
